Welcome to Simple Sales, a simple version of an app where users can buy and sell items. This repository is the backend for the react app

To get started, you will need to also clone the frontend repo at: https://github.com/habeshawit/react-project-frontend

## Installation

### Backend
In the backend repository, open a terminal and run the following commands to set up the back end database:

```
$ git clone 
$ bundle install
$ rails db:create && db:migrate
$ rails db:seed
$ rails s
```

### Frontend
Once you have the backend setup, clone the [frontend repo](http://localhost:3000) and follow the steps to run the app.
